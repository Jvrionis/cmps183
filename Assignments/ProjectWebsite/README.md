# ScholarshipWebsite

Create a website for a particular company that would offer scholarships to the potential students. The goal is to create a website that serves as a database for the information provided by multiple student applicants. Students will be asked to input their name, date of birth, school, as well as a 750 word summary. The information will then be stored in the database. Only a student who submitted will be able to edit his or her application, and only an administrator will be able to review applications sent by students.
