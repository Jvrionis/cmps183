        <h3>Polar bears finding it harder to catch enough 
                            seals to meet energy demands</h3>
        <b>Study reveals high metabolic rates, meaning polar
        bears need a lot of fat-rich prey, but more than 
        half of those studied were running an energy 
                                                deficit.</b>

    <div class="item3">
        <p>A new study finds polar bears in the wild have higher 
        metabolic rates than previously thought, and as climate 
        change alters their environment a growing number of beam 
        are unable to catch enough prey to meet their energy needs.</p>
        
        <p>The study, published February 2 in Science, reveals 
        the physiological mechanisms behind observed declines 
        in polar bear populations, said first author Anthony Pagano, 
        a Ph.D. candidate at UC Santa Cruz. "We've been documenting 
        declines in polar bear survival rates, body condition, and 
        population numbers over the past decade," he said. This 
        study identifies the mechanisms that are driving those 
        declines by looking at the actual energy needs of polar 
        bears and how often they're able to catch seals."</p>

        <p>Pagano, who is also a wildlife biologist with the U.S. 
        Geological Survey (USGS), conducted the study as part of 
        his Ph.D. thesis research at UC Santa Cruz, where he has 
        been working with coauthors Terrie Williams and Daniel Costa, 
        both professors of ecology and evolutionary biology</p>

    <div class="item4"> 
        <p>The researchers monitored the behavior, hunting success, 
        and metabolic rates of adult female polar bears without cubs 
        as they hunted for prey on the sea ice of the Beaufort Sea in 
        the spring. High-tech collars on the bears recorded video, 
        locations, and activity levels over a period of eight to 11 
        days, while metabolic tracers enabled the team to determine 
        how much energy the bears expended.</p>
    
        <p>The field metabolic rates they measured averaged more than
        50 percent higher than previous studies had predicted Five of 
        the nine bears in the study lost body mass, meaning they 
        weren't catching enough fat-rich marine mammal prey to meet 
        their energy demands.</p>

        <p>This was at the start of the period from April through 
        July when polar bears catch most of their prey and put on 
        most of the body fat they need to sustain them throughout 
        the year," Pagano said.</p>
